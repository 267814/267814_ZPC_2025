{{< img-text title="Intro" >}}
In this mini-project, we were introduced to 3D scanning and modeling. In reality, most of us already knew how to make CAD models, assemblies, and what 3D scanning is. However, there were some students new to this field. This mini-project was divided into 4 tasks, in which we tested our knowledge and experience in SolidWorks. As a holder of 2 certificates (CSWA, CSWP), these tasks were not as hard for me as for others.

{{< img-text title="Digital Drawing Board" >}}
This section shows the work I did in CAD, which is basically the starting point for almost every project. I used the **SolidWorks** software to design my parts. Before you can make or print anything, you first have to build it on the computer. My goal here was to get comfortable with the software by designing many different kinds of objects. I practiced making everything from simple shapes to more complex assemblies with multiple parts that fit together.

{{< 3d-model title="Piston-Rod" src="/models/piston.glb" >}}
The first task was to make a piston-rod. This one was the easiest of them all because it covered the basic features in SolidWorks. It showed how to make a sketch, what extrude is, etc.

{{< 3d-model title="Shaft" src="/models/shaft.glb" >}}
Here the main core of the task wasn't the model itself but the drawing. Also a very simple task that requires not only knowing how SolidWorks works but also norms and rules for technical drawings.

{{< img-text title="Technical Drawing" >}}
As said before, to make this drawing we needed to know how to correctly make a drawing. It is a fairly easy drawing most of us already learned in high school. However, there are some things that you need technical knowledge about (*for example: Geometrical Tolerances, Tolerances, etc.*).

What is in the drawing:
* Dimensions
* Tolerances
* Geometrical Tolerances
* Bases
* Section views
* Surface Roughness
* Additional Notes

{{< 3d-model title="Cardan Assembly" src="/models/cardan.glb" >}}
In this task, we were given an assembly to put together. Basically, it's a lever that is connected to a joint. Specifically, the lever is connected to a cardan, which then rotates with the shaft with the rigid sides.

{{< 3d-model title="Holder" src="/models/holder.glb" >}}
After we completed the easier tasks, the more experienced ones moved to these 2 tasks. These were quite harder than the others, but in the end, it was all about a little thinking and trying.

{{< 3d-model title="Cover" src="/models/cover.glb" >}}
On the other hand, the cover was indeed hard. It definitely took me longer than I expected. Here we had to use our 3D imagination to another level because the drawing provided was as little dimensioned as it could be.

{{< chapter title="02. 3D Printing" subtitle="Mechanical Prototype" >}}

{{< img-text title="Mechanical Sign" >}}
For my 3D printing project, I wanted to move beyond static models and create something with functional, moving parts. I decided to design and build a mechanical desk status sign that can switch between **"FREE"** and **"BUSY."** This project was a perfect test of designing for assembly, checking tolerances, and printing multiple interlocking components.

{{< img-text title="Disassembled View" src="/images/Dissasambled.jpg" >}}
Here are all the individual components that make up the final assembly, laid out before being put together. I designed this as a multi-part print, using contrasting black and white filaments to give it a clean look. 

You can see the base, the main vertical supports, the large spur gear, the smaller pinion gear, the knobs, and of course, the two "FREE" and "BUSY" signs, which are designed to function as gear racks.

{{< img-text title="The Mechanism" src="/images/Mechanism.jpg" reverse="true" size="portrait" >}}
This close-up shot shows the core of the device. The entire mechanism is manually operated by turning the small knob at the bottom. This knob is attached to a small pinion gear. 

This pinion drives the larger spur gear at a **2:1 gear ratio**, which makes the motion smooth and controlled. This rotational motion is then converted into linear motion using a rack and pinion system.

{{< img-text title="Final Product in Action" >}}
And here is the final, assembled product demonstrating its two states. When I turn the knob, the gear system engages smoothly. The 2:1 ratio means that a 180-degree turn of the large gear swaps the signs. 

It was a complete success, and now I have a functional, 3D-printed gadget for my desk.
