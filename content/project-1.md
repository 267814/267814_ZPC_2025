This project focuses on building a personal portfolio from the ground up, deliberately bypassing drag-and-drop website builders to ensure full control over the underlying code. Developed within Visual Studio Code, the site is powered by Hugo, a fast and flexible Static Site Generator (SSG). For the frontend architecture, I leveraged HTML combined with Tailwind CSS, utilizing its utility-first approach to streamline styling and ensure a responsive, clean codebase.

The visual identity is anchored in a dark mode aesthetic, chosen for its modern elegance and reduced eye strain. To establish a distinct visual hierarchy, I integrated high-contrast neon accents that draw attention to key elements. The content is organized using a Bento grid layout, dividing information into modular, interactive tiles. To enhance the User Experience (UX), I implemented fluid motion design—including smooth transitions and micro-interactions—resulting in a seamless and engaging navigation flow.

The final stage involved deploying the static site via GitHub Pages. This workflow integrates git for rigorous version control, allowing me to track the development history and manage branches effectively. This setup significantly accelerates the iteration cycle, enabling me to identify and debug issues rapidly while pushing new content and project updates to the live server instantaneously.
