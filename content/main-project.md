The **Joystick-Controlled Tripod** is a motorized camera stand designed to provide precise and intuitive control over device positioning.  
Using a joystick, the user can easily adjust the tripod’s height, rotate it a full 360°, and tilt the mounted phone or camera to the desired angle.  

The system is powered by an Arduino controller in combination with a gyroscope, ensuring smooth and accurate movements.  
Additionally, the tripod includes a dedicated button that instantly resets the device to its default home position, offering both convenience and reliability during operation.
