As a first mini-project, I created a simple personal website to learn the basics of web development and online publishing. The site was built using Visual Studio Code for editing, the command line for project setup and management, and GitHub for version control and hosting. This project introduced me to essential development tools and workflows that I will continue to build on in future assignments.
