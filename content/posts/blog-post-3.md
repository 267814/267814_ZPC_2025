# Intro

***

---

___

In this mini-project we were introduced do 3D scanning and modeling. In reality most of us have already known how to make CAD models, assemblies and what is 3D scanning. However there were some students that were new to this field.
This mini-project was devied into 4 task, in which we tested our knowledge and experinece in SolidWorks. Me as a holder of 2 certificates (CSWA, CSWP), were these tasks not as hard as for others.
After I made all of the models and assembly, I save them as .STEP files and imported them into Fusion to make the interactive models on this web.

# Piston-rod

___

The first task was to make a piston-rod. This one was the easiest of them all, beceause it covered the basic features in SolidWorks. It showed how to make sktech, what is extrude etc. Overall very simple model.

# Shaft

___

Here the main core of the task wasn't the model itself but the drawing. Also very simple task, that requires not only how SolidWorks works, but also norms and rules how to make a technical drawing.

## Drawing

As said before to make this drawing we needed to know how to correctly make a drawing. It is a fairly easy drawing most of us already leant in high school. However there are some things that you need technical knowledge about *(for example: Geometrical Tolerances, Tolerances, etc.)*

What is in the drawing:
  - Dimensions
  - Tolerances
  - Geometrical Tolerances
  - Bases
  - Section views
  - Surface Roughness
  - Additional Notes
