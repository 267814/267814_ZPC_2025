# Intro

***

---

___

In this mini-project we were introduced do 3D scanning and modeling. In reality most of us have already known how to make CAD models, assemblies and what is 3D scanning. However there were some students that were new to this field.
This mini-project was devied into 4 task, in which we tested our knowledge and experinece in SolidWorks. Me as a holder of 2 certificates (CSWA, CSWP), were these tasks not as hard as for others.
After I made all of the models and assembly, I save them as .STEP files and imported them into Fusion to make the interactive models on this web.

# Piston-rod

***

---

___

The first task was to make a piston-rod. This one was the easiest of them all, beceause it covered the basic features in SolidWorks. It showed how to make sktech, what is extrude etc. Overall very simple model.

# Shaft

***

---

___

Here the main core of the task wasn't the model itself but the drawing. Also very simple task, that requires not only how SolidWorks works, but also norms and rules how to make a technical drawing.

## Drawing

As said before to make this drawing we needed to know how to correctly make a drawing. It is a fairly easy drawing most of us already leant in high school. However there are some things that you need technical knowledge about *(for example: Geometrical Tolerances, Tolerances, etc.)*

What is in the drawing:
  - Dimensions
  - Tolerances
  - Geometrical Tolerances
  - Bases
  - Section views
  - Surface Roughness
  - Additional Notes

# Cardan assembly

***

---

___

In this task, we were given an assembly to put together. Basicly it's a lever that is connected to a joint. Specificaly the lever is conected to a cardan, which then rotates with the shaft with the rigid sides.

# Holder

***

---

___

After we completed the easier tasks, the more experienced ones moved to these 2 tasks. These were quite harder then the others, but in the end it was all about a little thinking and trying. For both the holder and the cover were provided technical drawings. Howerver they were made so you have to think about the right approach. Even though the holder was harder it used many basic features.

# Cover

***

---

___

On the other hand, the cover was indeed hard. It definetley took me longer then I expected. Here we had to use our 3D imagination to another level, bcs the drawing which was provided was as little dimensioned as it could. The biggest role had the base sketch, which needed to be designed as good as possible in order to bypass potential problems in the model.
