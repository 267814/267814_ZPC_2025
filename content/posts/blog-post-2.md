# Intro

___

This mini-project was focused on 2D graphics and it's usage. More specifically we were introduced to Plotter and Laser cutter. More info about each machine is under it's section. This mini-project was overall very interesting, in which we learnt how to make our own logo and taht make it come to life. And also this mini-project needs to be used in my [main project](https://267814.github.io/267814_ZPC_2025/main-project/).

In this task we had to make our own logo. So I chose to use my initials and fuse them together. 
The procces was fairly easy. First of all I had to learn what is vector graphics. Then i began to sketch my logo on paper, and after I was satisfied with teh result I took a photo of it so I could send it to my PC. In order to make the logo, I used a program called Inkscape.

After the logo was recreated into a vector graphic I uploaded it into the plotter. There in another program I placed and scaled it. From there the rest of the process is pretty straight forward, where the plotter cuts out the logo and I take it of the sticky paper.

## Final product

In the end you take the logo and stick it on a transparent tape like piece, so you can then place it where ever you want. For example I put it on my laptop charger.
